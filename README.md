# Project-1-8-puzzle
Project 1 : 8 puzzle

The program is coded in python3

The program requires numpy library package

To run the Program,
1. open the Project 1.ipynb file
2. First click on Raw
3. Then, press ctrl+s to save it as .ipynb (Note that you'll have to manually type '.ipynb' after the file name to make this work, as files from GitHub are saved as text files as default.)
4. Open jupyter notebook
5. Go to location where you saved .ipynb file
6. Open file, you will see the code
7. If you still find .txt after opening the file in jupyter notebooks, then just rename the file by removeing .txt
8. reopen the file, you will see the code
9. hit run all cells
10. you will be asked to give the input to test
11. If solvable, the output files will be generated on the same folder as the .ipynb file is saved ( similar to the three .txt files in the repository)

You could also,
1. https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ paste the url of the .ipynb file in this website and hit go
2. on the viewer page, you could choose mybinder to execute the code online
3. Note few times, package error could be thrown

You could also,
1. Clone the repo which contains ipynb notebook (replace $link to the actual link)
2. $ git clone $link
3. Go to the path where ipynb is cloned
4. Open Jupyter notebook to see the file. (replace $filename with the actual filename)
5. jupyter notebook $filename
