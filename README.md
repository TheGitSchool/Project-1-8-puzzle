# Project-1-8-puzzle
Project 1 : 8 puzzle

The program is coded in python3
The program requires numpy library package

To run the Program,
1. open the Project 1.ipynb file
2. First click on Raw
3. Then, press ctrl+s to save it as .ipynb (Note that you'll have to manually type '.ipynb' after the file name to make this work, as files from GitHub are saved as text files as default.)
Open jupyter notebook
Go to location where you saved .ipynb file
Open file, you will see the code
If you still find .txt after opening the file in jupyter notebooks, then just rename the file by removeing .txt
reopen the file
hit run all cells
you will be asked to give the input to test
If solvable, the output files will be generated on the same folder as the .ipynb file is saved
